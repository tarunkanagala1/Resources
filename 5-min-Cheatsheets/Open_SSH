1) To check SSH is installed on the system.
apt search openssh-client 

Now open the command line and type in the commands in the shell.

ssh root(username) @ip-address
#add password
cd ~/.ssh
ls
#goes to ssh file directory

2)CONFIGURING OPEN SSH CLIENTS
cd ~/.ssh
ls
#create file
touch config
#open and edit 
nano config

#Type the following IN CONFIG FILE
Host server-name
    Hostname ip-address
    Port 22
    User username
#Now save the file
#now we can use server-name to connect to server
ssh server-name

3)USING PUBLIC/PRIVATE KEYS
ssh-keygen #to create a key 
cat id_rsa # never show this THIS IS PRIVATE KEY
cat id_rsa.pub #PUBLIC KEY 

#to delete keys
rm id_rsa*

#to recreate keys
ssh-keygen

4)#SETTING UP SERVER
4.1) LONG WAY
cat id_rsa.pub 
#copy to server
ssh server-name @ip-address
#SETUP SERVER TO ADD CONNECTIONS 
cd .ssh (No such file or directory)
#Now create ssh folder
pwd
mkdir.ssh  (Makes dir )
ls-la
ls
#create a file authorized_keys
nano authorized_keys

#IN authorized_keys file
PASTE PUBLIC KEY OF THE ID_RSA.PUB file
#save

FROM NEXT TIME IT DOESN'T ASK FOR PASSWORD WHILE CONNECTING

#to find more info 
ssh -v server-name@ip-address

4.2) SHORT WAY
ssh server-name@ip-address
cd .ssh (NO file or direcctory)
 #COMMAND FOR COPYING KEYS TO REMOTE SERVERS
ssh-copy-id -i input-dir username@ip-address
Ex:) ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh./id_rsa.pub root@172.105.7.26

5)#MANAGING SSH KEYS

#CREATE DIFF TYPE OF KEY 
ssh-keygen -t ed25519(type of key) -C"comment"
cat id_ed25519.pub

#TO USE SSH AGENT TO AVOID TYPING PASSWORD EVERYTIME
#TO START SSH AGENT
eval "$(ssh-agent)"
ps aux |grep ssh-agent
#TO ADD KEY TO SSH AGENT
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ec25519
#ENTER PASSKEY 
#KEY ADDED

6)#CONFIGURING OpenSSH

#SERVER COMPONENT
#sshd-> server component
which sshd
systemctl status sshd(status)
systemctl restart sshd(restart)
systemctl stop sshd(stop)
systemctl start sshd(start)

cd /etc/ssh
ls -l
#sshd_config file is what changed to whatever to configure
nano sshd_config
#scroll down and DISABLE PASSWORDAUTHENTICATION TO NO
#change port number to avoid random online attacks
ssh -p 2222 server-name@ip-address

7)#TROUBLESHOOTING OpenSSH

1)CHECK PERMISSIONS 
2)LOG FILES
#check log files using journal built-in 
journal -u ssh
